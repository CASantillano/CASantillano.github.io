* [Lab 8 part 1:](https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3445940/assignments/35652804)

    I enjoyed Lab 8 part 1 because it was overall just a more interesting topic for me. Perhaps I was just hungry at the time of coding, but the sandwiches were a fun mad lib to work with. I believe the main learning objectives were to verify whether or not the number of arguments are correct, and also displaying the correct output for any given input.


* [Lab 4 part 1:](https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3445940/assignments/35652795)

    I enjoyed Lab 4 part 1 because it was very straight-forward. The use of double variables allowed for the code to flow very smoothly for the output. It was very aesthetically pleasing. The learning objective for this lab was to learn how to use double variables in conjunction with mathematical operators in order to calculate conversion values between different measuring units.

* [Lab 4 part 2:](https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3445940/assignments/35652795)

    I enjoyed Lab 4 part 2, which was the Hi-Lo game, because it was very short and concise. You set a secret number and checked if the input values matched the set secret number, and gave the correct output according to the input. This was a very simple game and was overall just fun to code. The learning objective for this lab was to learn how to use if statements in functional code.
